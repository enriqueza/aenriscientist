Waves are coming and going 

Tides keep coming back

And laughing at us

Telling us we can't succeed

But the farmer doesn't plant 

their seed in unfertile soil

Not in sand, where grains are washed away

Not on rocky bare land

where the soil is hardened and 

Cracked

But in a garden

of cultivated soil.

Where that same water

From the Tides

From the Waves

To the Clouds

To the earth

reaches soft, supple soil

And we use it

To grow.
